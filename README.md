# SafeFirst
A women's safety device powered by the 8051 microcontroller.
The project aims to implement a personal protection device which can be used particularly by women or children to enforce safety in case of emergency situations. The device prototype could be extended to a miniature safety gizmo which could be clipped to jeans, belts or handbags when it is difficult and time consuming to access the phone.
